## How I think it should be done
To become a proper DJ I believe you need 3 things:
* **An ear for music**
* _The ability to read a crowd_
* **_Motivation and Drive_**

## Practice Practice Practice
[10,000 hours of practice is said to be needed for mastery in a field.](http://www.digitaldjtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CDJ2000NXS2.jpg) Practicing should be the number one thing that propels you success.
